## Digital Innovation One - Java Developer Challenges

In this repository I record all the DIO challenges I completed, covering all content related to `Java`, from object-oriented programming to API development!

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

I appreciate all the support, thank you everyone!
